# Fourier-Optics-Analysis
  Fourier analysis is a key tool in physics and engineering in the broadest sense and is particularly used in the field of optics to design and study the properties of advanced imaging systems. For my E90 final project, I intend to explore areas describing a simple experimental setup that illustrates the spatial frequency-domain response of a simple optical system. This experiment clearly demonstrates spatial transfer function concepts in Fourier optics, complementing and extending other studies of Fourier transforms in physics that may consider similar ideas in a time and frequency signal-processing context. Future applications include the optical data processor or optical computer. The basis of spatial filtering is Fraunhofer diffraction from the object whose image is to be spatially filtered.
